# ZHERO (Zero Hunger & Efficient Resource Optimization) 
**ZHERO** is an innovative food waste management system designed to tackle hunger and optimize the use of resources. By tracking, managing, and redistributing surplus food, ZHERO reduces food waste while improving food security in local communities. It connects food donors (such as restaurants, grocery stores, and households) with organizations that help those in need, ensuring that edible food doesn’t go to waste.

# Project Overview
Food waste is a global issue, contributing to both environmental degradation and food insecurity. **ZHERO** (Zero Hunger & Efficient Resource Optimization) is designed to bridge the gap by:


**Reducing food waste:** By efficiently tracking and redistributing surplus food.

**Feeding communities:** Connecting local food donors with food banks, shelters, and individuals in need.

**Promoting resource optimization:** Encouraging sustainability practices in food production, consumption, and redistribution.


The system offers features for both food donors and recipients, creating a seamless platform for food waste reduction.

# Alignment with SDGs
**ZHERO** is aligned with two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

## **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**
***"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."***

**ZHERO** directly contributes to SDG 2 by:

**Reducing Food Waste:** The system helps to redistribute surplus food to those in need, preventing food that would otherwise go to waste from contributing to hunger in local communities.

**Increasing Food Access:** By connecting donors (restaurants, retailers, and households) with recipients (food banks, shelters, and charities), we provide more equitable access to food, especially for vulnerable populations.

**Promoting Nutrition:** Donated food often includes a variety of nutritious options, ensuring that beneficiaries receive balanced meals.
By supporting efficient redistribution, ZHERO helps ensure that food is not wasted but is instead used to help combat hunger and promote food security.

## SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
***"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns."***

**ZHERO** is also a key enabler of SDG 12 by:

**Encouraging Waste Reduction:** The platform's design and features promote the responsible use of food resources. By tracking food expiration dates and facilitating donations, we reduce unnecessary food wastage and ensure food is put to optimal use.

**Promoting Circular Economy Practices:** ZHERO helps promote a circular approach to food resources—food that would otherwise end up in landfills is repurposed for consumption, reducing the environmental burden associated with food waste.

**Optimizing Food Resource Distribution:** The system helps food producers, retailers, and consumers identify surplus food and optimize its redistribution, supporting sustainable production and consumption cycles.
**ZHERO** works towards SDG 12 by addressing both the environmental and social dimensions of food waste, helping to create a more sustainable food ecosystem.
